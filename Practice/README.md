# LaGuardiaELJ101Asynch
## Practices
- Resources for the practice section of a fully asynchronous elementary-level Japanese class (ELJ101) at LaGuardia Community College.
- All resources are shared in simple text or CSV formats so that each instructor can import them into their own LMS platforms (e.g., Blackboard or Brightspace). Image files are shared in low resolution to save hard drive space.
- Almost all resources were developed using the following AI tools and were manually edited/corrected by human instructors:
    - DeepSeek (<http://deepseek.com>)
    - OpenAI ChatGPT (<http://chatgpt.com>)
    - Google Imagen3 (<https://gemini.google.com>)
- An HTML version of these practice resources is available at <https://t-nagano.com/mycourses/ELJ101Asynch/>.
